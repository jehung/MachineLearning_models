# Comparison of Supervised Learning Models: Case Studies with Two Classification Problems

## Explanation of Files

The zip folder includes the following files:

#### Jupyter Notebook
- `ML_models_freddie-refactored.ipynb`

#### Python code file
- `multiple_model.py`
- get_all_data.py
- get_all_data_bloodDonation.py

#### Data files
- sample_orig_2016.txt
- sample_svcg_2016.txt
- train_cleaned.csv

#### Report
- Assign1_report.docx


The Jupyter Notebook and the Python code files contain exactly the same content, just different implementations. You can choose to either run the single Jupyter Notebook (ML_models_freddie-refactored.ipynb), or run multiple_model.py in Python IDE or at the command line. Either way, the code will import all required modules, read in all required data and performed the same set of computations.

## Required Packages

To run the Python code, you must have already installed the following:
- `NumPy`
- `Pandas`
- `datetime`
- `time`
- `matplotlib`
- `sklearn.model_selection`
- `sklearn.tree`
- `sklearn.neural_network`
- `skelarn.svm`
- `sklearn.ensemble`
- `sklearn.neighbors`
- `joblib`
